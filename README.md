# ANubela Privacy Policy

This repository hosts the public privacy policy for **ANubela**, a personal journaling app created by Cosmic Diary Studio.

## Summary
- All data (mood entries, Soul Question, sticker seeds) stays on device using SwiftData.
- No accounts, analytics SDKs, or third-party sharing.
- Photos permission is only used when exporting stickers to the photo library.
- Delete the app to remove all stored data.
- Contact: [support@example.com](mailto:support@example.com) (replace with your real mailbox).

The full policy is published as a static page: `index.html`. You can view it locally or serve it via GitHub Pages.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Clone this repo or copy the files into your own GitHub repository.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose “Deploy from branch”, keep branch set to `main` and folder `/`.
4. Wait for Pages to build, then use the generated URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/anubela-privacy/`) in App Store Connect.

### Local preview
```
python3 -m http.server
# open http://localhost:8000 in a browser
```

Any update to the policy can be made by editing `index.html` (or `docs/privacy-policy.md` in the app repo) and re-deploying.
